#Swarm Optimization

Today's exercise is a follow-up on yesterday's gradient descent exercise.


We will be learning a more advanced algorithm in order to optimize for more
complex cost functions.


The exercise is in the ```morning``` folder, together with the solutions.
Refer to ```morning_exercise.md``` for instructions.


There are a number of papers in the ```readings``` folder if you are interested
to dig deeper into the subject. The ```readings``` are not required to complete
the exercises.


The morning lecture is in ```lecture.md```.
