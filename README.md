#Swarm Optimization

Today's exercise is a follow-up on yesterday's gradient descent exercise.


We will be learning a more advanced algorithm in order to optimize for more
complex cost functions.


The exercise supporting code files are in the ```code``` folder. Refer to ```exercise.md``` for instructions. (solutions can be found in the `solutions` branch of this repo).


There are a number of papers in the ```references``` folder if you are interested
to dig deeper into the subject. The ```references``` are not required to complete
the exercises.


The morning lecture is in ```lecture.pdf```.
